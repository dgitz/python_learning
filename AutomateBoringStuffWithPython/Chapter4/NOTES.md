# Notes
## Methods
A 'method' is the same thing as a function, except it is called on a value.

Example:
spam.index('hello'): index method

## Mutable and Immutable Data Types
### Mutable
list
### Immutable
string
tuple
Integers


## Lists vs Tuples
- Lists are created using Brackets.  Examples:
   >>> cats = ['Anne','Sam','Mark']
- Tuples are created using Parentheses.  Examples:
   >>> cats = ('Anne','Sam','Mark') 
- Lists are stored in order.
