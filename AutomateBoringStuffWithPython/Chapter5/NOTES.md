# Dictionaries
- Indexes for dictionaries can be many different data types, not just integers.
- These indexes for dictionaries are called 'keys', and a key with its associated value is a 'key-value pair'
- Dictionaries are typed with '{ }'.  Example:
   >>> myCat = {'size': 'fat', 'color': 'gray', 'disposition': 'loud'}
   >>> myCat['size']
   'fat'
   >>> spam = {12345: 'Luggage Combination', 42: 'The Answer' }
   >>> spam[42]
   'The Answer'
- Dictionariesare stored unordered
- Because dictionaries are not ordered, they can't be sliced like lists

## Methods of Dictionaries
- keys(): A list of keys in the dictionary

- values(): A list of values in the dictionary

- items(): A list of key/value pairs in the dictionary
